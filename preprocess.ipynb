      "SUPPLEMENT A DECISION MAKING MODELS Operations managers make many decisions as they manage processes and supply chains. Although the specifics of each situation vary, decision making generally involves the same basic steps: (1) recognize and clearly define the problem, (2) collect the information needed to analyze possible alternatives, and (3) choose and implement the most feasible alternative. Sometimes, hard thinking in a quiet room is sufficient. At other times, interacting with others or using more formal procedures are needed. Here, we present four such formal procedures: break-even analysis, the preference matrix, decision theory, and the decision tree. Break-even analysis helps the manager identify how much change in volume or demand is necessary before a second alternative becomes better than the first alternative. The preference matrix helps a manager deal with multiple criteria that cannot be evaluated with a single measure of merit, such as total profit or cost. Decision theory helps the manager choose the best alternative when outcomes are uncertain. A decision tree helps the manager when decisions are made sequentially—when today’s best decision depends on tomorrow’s decisions and events. break-even quantity The volume at which total revenues equal total costs.

This technique helps the manager answer questions, such as the following: Sportstock/Shutterstock Is the predicted sales volume of the service or product sufficient to break even (neither earning a profit nor sustaining a loss)? How low must the variable cost per unit be to break even, based on current prices and sales forecasts? How low must the fixed cost be to break even? How do price levels affect the break-even volume? Break-even analysis is based on the assumption that all costs related to the production of a specific service or prodA manager is doing some hard thinking and analysis on his computer uct can be divided into two categories: (1) variable costs and before reaching a final decision. (2) fixed costs. The variable cost, c, is the portion of the total cost that varies directly with volume of output: costs per unit for materials, labor, and usually some fraction of overhead. If we let Q equal variable cost the number of customers served or units produced per year, total variable cost = cQ. The fixed cost, F, is the portion of the total cost that remains constant regardless of changes in levels of The portion of the total cost that output: the annual cost of renting or buying new equipment and facilities (including depreciavaries directly with volume of tion, interest, taxes, and insurance); salaries; utilities; and portions of the sales or advertising output.\n",

Here we assess the sensitivity of total profit to different pricing strategies, sales volume forecasts, or cost estimates.

Sensitivity Analysis of Sales Forecasts If the most pessimistic sales forecast for the proposed service in Figure A.1 were 1,500 patients, what would be the procedure’s total contribution to profit and overhead per year? SOLUTION The graph shows that even the pessimistic forecast lies above the break-even volume, which is encouraging. The procedure’s total contribution, found by subtracting total costs from total revenues, is pQ - (F + cQ) = 200(1,500) - [100,000 + 100(1,500)] = $50,000 DECISION POINT Even with the pessimistic forecast, the new procedure contributes $50,000 per year.\n",

For the make-or-buy decision, it is the quantity for which the total “buy” cost equals the total “make” cost.

      "45,000 DECISION MAKING MODELS SUPPLEMENT A 55 Figure A.2 shows the solution from OM Explorer’s Break-Even Analysis Solver. The break-even quantity is 19,200 salads. As the 25,000-salad sales forecast exceeds this amount, the make option is preferred. Only if the restaurant expected to sell fewer than 19,200 salads would the buy option be better. DECISION POINT Management chose the make option after considering other qualitative factors, such as customer preferences and demand uncertainty. A deciding factor was that the 25,000-salad sales forecast is well above the 19,200-salad break-even quantity. Preference Matrix Decisions often must be made in situations where multiple criteria cannot be naturally merged into a single measure (such as dollars). For example, a manager deciding in which of two cities to locate a new plant would have to consider such unquantifiable factors as quality of life, worker attitudes toward work, and community reception in the two cities. These important factors cannot be ignored. A preference matrix is a table that allows the manager to rate an alternative according to several performance criteria. The criteria can be scored on any scale, such as from 1 (worst possible) to 10 (best possible) or from 0 to 1, as long as the same scale is applied to all the alternatives being compared.\n",

Another new product idea is better, considering the multiple criteria, and management only wanted to introduce one new product at the time. Not all managers are comfortable with the preference matrix technique. It requires the manager to state criteria weights before examining the alternatives, although the proper weights may not be readily apparent. Perhaps, only after seeing the scores for several alternatives can the manager decide what is important and what is not. Because a low score on one criterion can be compensated for or overridden by high scores on others, the preference matrix method also may cause managers to ignore important signals. In Example A.4, the investment required for the thermal storage air conditioner might exceed the firm’s financial capability.\n",
      "\n",

      "It helps operations managers with decisions on process, capacity, location, and inventory because such decisions are about an uncertain future. Decision theory can also be used by managers in other functional areas. With decision theory, a manager makes choices using the following process: 1. List the feasible alternatives. One alternative that should always be considered as a basis for reference is to do nothing. A basic assumption is that the number of alternatives is finite. For example, in deciding where to locate a new retail store in a certain part of the city, a manager could theoretically consider every grid coordinate on the city’s map. Realistically, however, the manager must narrow the number of choices to a reasonable number. 2. List the events (sometimes called chance events or states of nature) that have an impact on the outcome of the choice but are not under the manager’s control. For example, the demand experienced by the new facility could be low or high, depending not only on whether the location is convenient to many customers, but also on what the competition does and general retail trends.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, group events into reasonable categories. For example, suppose that the average number of sales per day could be anywhere from 1 to 500. Rather than have 500 events, the manager could represent demand with just 3 events: 100 sales/day, 300 sales/day, or 500 sales/day.\n",

If significant distortions will occur if the time value of money is not recognized, the payoffs should be expressed as present values or internal rates of return (see MyOMLab Supplement F.)

If the manager knows that future demand will be low, the company should build a small facility and enjoy a payoff of $200,000. The larger facility has a payoff of only $160,000. The “do nothing” alternative is dominated by the other alternatives; that is, the outcome of one alternative is no better than the outcome of another alternative for each event. Because the “do nothing” alternative is dominated, the manager does not consider it further. DECISION POINT If management really knows future demand, it would build the small facility if demand will be low and the large facility if demand will be high.

The manager has less information than with decision making under certainty, but more information than with decision making under uncertainty. For this intermediate situation, the expected value decision rule is widely used (both in practice and in this book).

Decision Trees The decision tree method is a general approach to a wide range of processes and supply chain decisions, such as product planning, process analysis, process capacity, and location. It is particularly valuable for evaluating different capacity expansion alternatives when demand is uncertain and sequential decisions are involved. For example, a company may expand a facility in 2013 only to discover in 2016 that demand is much higher than forecasted. In that case, a second decision may be necessary to determine whether to expand again or build a second facility. A decision tree is a schematic model of alternatives available to the decision maker, along with their possible consequences. The name derives from the tree-like appearance of the model. It consists of a number of square nodes, representing decision points, which are left by branches (which should be read from left to right), representing the alternatives. Branches leaving circular, or chance, nodes represent the events. The probability of each chance event, P(E), is shown above each branch. The probabilities for all branches leaving a chance node must sum to 1.0. The conditional payoff, which is the payoff for each possible alternative-event combination, is shown at the end of each combination.\n",

After drawing a decision tree, we solve it by working from right to left, calculating the expected payoff for each node as follows: 1. For an event node, we multiply the payoff of each event branch by the event’s probability. We add these products to get the event node’s expected payoff. 2. For a decision node, we pick the alternative that has the best expected payoff. If an alternative leads to an event node, its payoff is equal to that node’s expected payoff (already calculated).

If a small facility is built and demand proves to be high, the manager may choose not to expand (payoff = $223,000) or to expand (payoff = $270,000). If a small facility is built and demand is low, there is no reason to expand and the payoff is $200,000. If a large facility is built and demand proves to be low, the choice is to do nothing ($40,000) or to stimulate demand through local advertising. The response to advertising may be either modest or sizable, with their probabilities estimated to be 0.3 and 0.7, respectively. If it is modest, the payoff is estimated to be only $20,000; the payoff grows to $220,000 if the response is sizable. Finally, if a large facility is built and demand turns out to be high, the payoff is $800,000.\n",

      "Draw a decision tree. Then analyze it to determine the expected payoff for each decision and event node. Which alternative—building a small facility or building a large facility—has the higher expected payoff? SOLUTION The decision tree in Figure A.5 shows the event probability and the payoff for each of the seven alternativeevent combinations. The first decision is whether to build a small or a large facility. Its node is shown first, to the left, because it is the decision the retailer must make now. The second decision node—whether to expand at a later date—is reached only if a small facility is built and demand turns out to be high. Finally, the third decision point—whether to advertise—is reached only if the retailer builds a large facility and demand turns out to be low.\n",

Management is trying to determine whether one or two lifts will be necessary; each lift can accommodate 250 people per day.

The first lift will operate at 90 percent capacity if economic conditions are bad, the probability of which is believed to be about a 0.3. During normal times the first lift will be utilized at 100 percent capacity, and the excess crowd will provide 50 percent utilization of the second lift. The probability of normal times is 0.5. Finally, if times are really good, the probability of which is 0.2, the utilization of the second lift will increase to 90 percent.

      "BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS 1. 2. Tri-County G&T sells 140,000 MWh per year of electrical power to Boulder at $70 per MWh, has fixed costs of $83.2 million per year, and has variable costs of $30 per MWh. If Tri-County has 2,000,000 MWh of demand from its customers (other than Boulder), what will Tri-County have to charge to break even? A news clipping service is considering modernization. Rather than manually clipping and photocopying articles of interest and mailing them to its clients, employees electronically input stories from most widely circulated publications into a database. Each new issue is searched for key words, such as a client’s company name, competitors’ names, type of business, and the company’s products, services, and officers. When matches occur, affected clients are instantly notified via an online network. If the story is of interest, it is electronically transmitted, so the client often has the story and can prepare comments for follow-up interviews before the publication hits the street. The manual process has fixed costs of $400,000 per year and variable costs of $6.20 per clipping mailed. The price charged the client is $8.00 per clipping. The computerized process has fixed costs of $1,300,000 per year and variable costs of $2.25 per story electronically transmitted to the client.\n",
