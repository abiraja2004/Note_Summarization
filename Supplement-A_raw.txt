DECISION MAKING
MODELS
Operations managers

make many decisions as they manage processes and supply
chains. Although the specifics of each situation vary, decision making generally involves the same
basic steps: (1) recognize and clearly define the problem, (2) collect the information needed to
analyze possible alternatives, and (3) choose and implement the most feasible alternative.
Sometimes, hard thinking in a quiet room is sufficient. At other times, interacting with others or using more formal procedures are needed. Here, we present four such formal procedures:
break-even analysis, the preference matrix, decision theory, and the decision tree.
 Break-even analysis helps the manager identify how much change in volume or demand is
necessary before a second alternative becomes better than the first alternative.
 The preference matrix helps a manager deal with multiple criteria that cannot be evaluated
with a single measure of merit, such as total profit or cost.
 Decision theory helps the manager choose the best alternative when outcomes are uncertain.
 A decision tree helps the manager when decisions are made sequentially—when today’s best
decision depends on tomorrow’s decisions and events.

Break-Even Analysis

break-even analysis

To evaluate an idea for a new service or product, or to assess the performance of an existing one,
determining the volume of sales at which the service or product breaks even is useful. The breakeven quantity is the volume at which total revenues equal total costs. Use of this technique is
known as break-even analysis. Break-even analysis can also be used to compare processes by
finding the volume at which two different processes have equal total costs.

COMPETING WITH OPERATIONS

Evaluating Services or Products
We begin with the first purpose: to evaluate the profit potential
of a new or existing service or product. This technique helps
the manager answer questions, such as the following:

Sportstock/Shutterstock

 Is the predicted sales volume of the service or product sufficient to break even (neither earning a profit nor sustaining a loss)?
 How low must the variable cost per unit be to break even,
based on current prices and sales forecasts?
 How low must the fixed cost be to break even?
 How do price levels affect the break-even volume?
Break-even analysis is based on the assumption that all
costs

can
be divided into two categories: (1) variable costs and
before reaching a final decision.
(2) fixed costs.
The variable cost, c, is the portion of the total cost that varies directly with volume of output: costs per unit for materials, labor, and usually some fraction of overhead. If we let Q equal

multiplied by volume, or
The portion of the total cost that
Total cost = F + cQ
remains constant regardless of
changes in levels of output.
The variable cost per unit is assumed to be the same no matter how small or large Q is, and
thus, total cost is linear. If we assume that all units produced are sold, total annual revenues equal
revenue per unit sold, p, multiplied by the quantity sold, or
Total revenue = pQ
If we set total revenue equal to total cost, we get the break-even quantity point as
pQ = F + cQ

1p - c2Q = F
Q =

F
p - c

We can also find this break-even quantity graphically. Because both costs and revenues
are linear relationships, the break-even quantity is where the total revenue line crosses the total
cost line.

Finding the Break-Even Quantity
A hospital is considering a new procedure to be offered at $200 per patient. The fixed cost per year would be
$100,000, with total variable costs of $100 per patient. What is the break-even quantity for this service? Use
both algebraic and graphic approaches to get the answer.

To solve graphically we plot two lines: one for costs and one for revenues. Two points determine a
line, so we begin by calculating costs and revenues for two different output levels. The following table
shows the results for Q = 0 and Q = 2,000. We selected zero as the first point because of the ease of plotting total revenue (0) and total cost (F ). However, we could have used any two reasonably spaced output
levels.

We can now draw the cost line through points (0, 100,000) and (2,000, 300,000). The revenue line goes
between (0, 0) and (2,000, 400,000). As Figure A.1 indicates, these two lines intersect at 1,000 patients, the
break-even quantity.
DECISION POINT
Management expects the number of patients needing the new procedure will exceed the 1,000-patient breakeven quantity but first wants to learn how sensitive the decision is to demand levels before making a final choice.
Break-even analysis cannot tell a manager whether to pursue a new service or product idea or drop
an existing line. The technique can only show what is likely to happen for various forecasts of costs and
sales volumes. To evaluate a variety of “what-if” questions, we use an approach called sensitivity analysis, a technique for systematically changing parameters in a model to determine the effects of such
changes. The concept can be applied later to other techniques, such as linear programming. Here we
assess the sensitivity of total profit to different pricing strategies, sales volume forecasts, or cost estimates.

Sensitivity Analysis of Sales Forecasts

If the most pessimistic sales forecast for the proposed service in Figure A.1 were 1,500 patients, what would be
the procedure’s total contribution to profit and overhead per year?
SOLUTION
The graph shows that even the pessimistic forecast lies above the break-even volume, which is encouraging.
The procedure’s total contribution, found by subtracting total costs from total revenues, is
pQ - (F + cQ) = 200(1,500) - [100,000 + 100(1,500)]
= $50,000
DECISION POINT
Even with the pessimistic forecast, the new procedure contributes $50,000 per year. After evaluating the proposal with present value method (see MyOMLab Supplement F), management added the new procedure to the
hospital’s services.

Evaluating Processes
Often, choices must be made between two processes or between an internal process and buying services or materials on the outside. In such cases, we assume that the decision does not affect revenues.
The manager must study all the costs and advantages of each approach. Rather than find the quantity
at which total costs equal total revenues, the analyst finds the quantity for which the total costs for

two alternatives are equal. For the make-or-buy decision, it is the quantity for which the total “buy”
cost equals the total “make” cost. Let Fb equal the fixed cost (per year) of the buy option, Fm equal the
fixed cost of the make option, cb equal the variable cost (per unit) of the buy option, and cm equal the
variable cost of the make option. Thus, the total cost to buy is Fb + cbQ and the total cost to make is
Fm + cmQ. To find the break-even quantity, we set the two cost functions equal and solve for Q:
Fb + cbQ = Fm + cmQ
Q =

Fm - Fb
cb - cm

The make option should be considered, ignoring qualitative factors, only if its variable costs
are lower than those of the buy option. The reason is that the fixed costs for making the service or
product are typically higher than the fixed costs for buying. Under these circumstances, the buy
option is better if production volumes are less than the break-even quantity. Beyond that quantity, the make option becomes better. Chapter 10, “Designing Effective Supply Chains,” brings out
other considerations when making make-or-buy decisions.

Break-Even Analysis for Make-or-Buy Decisions
The manager of a fast-food restaurant featuring hamburgers is adding salads to the menu. For each of the two
new options, the price to the customer will be the same. The make option is to install a salad bar stocked with vegetables, fruits, and toppings and let the customer assemble the salad. The salad bar would have to be leased and
a part-time employee hired. The manager estimates the fixed costs at $12,000 and variable costs totaling $1.50
per salad. The buy option is to have preassembled salads available for sale. They would be purchased from a local supplier at $2.00 per salad. Offering preassembled salads would require installation and operation of additional
refrigeration, with an annual fixed cost of $2,400. The manager expects to sell 25,000 salads per year.

Figure A.2 shows the solution from OM Explorer’s Break-Even Analysis Solver. The break-even quantity is
19,200 salads. As the 25,000-salad sales forecast exceeds this amount, the make option is preferred. Only if
the restaurant expected to sell fewer than 19,200 salads would the buy option be better.
DECISION POINT
Management chose the make option after considering other qualitative factors, such as customer preferences and demand uncertainty. A deciding factor was that the 25,000-salad sales forecast is well above the
19,200-salad break-even quantity.

Preference Matrix
Decisions often must be made in situations where multiple criteria cannot be naturally merged
into a single measure (such as dollars). For example, a manager deciding in which of two cities to
locate a new plant would have to consider such unquantifiable factors as quality of life, worker attitudes toward work, and community reception in the two cities. These important factors cannot
be ignored. A preference matrix is a table that allows the manager to rate an alternative according
to several performance criteria. The criteria can be scored on any scale, such as from 1 (worst possible) to 10 (best possible) or from 0 to 1, as long as the same scale is applied to all the alternatives
being compared. Each score is weighted according to its perceived importance, with the total of
these weights typically equaling 100. The total score is the sum of the weighted scores (weight ×
score) for all the criteria. The manager can compare the scores for alternatives against one another
or against a predetermined threshold.

PART 1

COMPETING WITH OPERATIONS

DECISION POINT
Management should drop the thermal storage air-conditioner idea. Another new product idea is better,
considering the multiple criteria, and management only wanted to introduce one new product at the time.

Not all managers are comfortable with the preference matrix technique. It requires the manager to state criteria weights before examining the alternatives, although the proper weights may
not be readily apparent. Perhaps, only after seeing the scores for several alternatives can the manager decide what is important and what is not. Because a low score on one criterion can be compensated for or overridden by high scores on others, the preference matrix method also may cause
managers to ignore important signals. In Example A.4, the investment required for the thermal
storage air conditioner might exceed the firm’s financial capability. In that case, the manager
should not even be considering the alternative, no matter how high its score.

Decision Theory
decision theory
A general approach to decision
making when the outcomes associated with alternatives are often
in doubt.

Decision theory is a general approach to decision making when the outcomes associated with
alternatives are often in doubt. It helps operations managers with decisions on process, capacity,
location, and inventory because such decisions are about an uncertain future. Decision theory
can also be used by managers in other functional areas. With decision theory, a manager makes
choices using the following process:
1.

List the feasible alternatives. One alternative that should always be considered as a basis for
reference is to do nothing. A basic assumption is that the number of alternatives is finite. For
example, in deciding where to locate a new retail store in a certain part of the city, a manager
could theoretically consider every grid coordinate on the city’s map. Realistically, however,
the manager must narrow the number of choices to a reasonable number.

2.

List the events (sometimes called chance events or states of nature) that have an impact on the
outcome of the choice but are not under the manager’s control. For example, the demand
experienced by the new facility could be low or high, depending not only on whether the
location is convenient to many customers, but also on what the competition does and general retail trends. Then, group events into reasonable categories. For example, suppose that
the average number of sales per day could be anywhere from 1 to 500. Rather than have 500
events, the manager could represent demand with just 3 events: 100 sales/day, 300 sales/day,
or 500 sales/day. The events must be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive, meaning
that they do not overlap and that they cover all eventualities.

3.

Calculate the payoff for each alternative in each event. Typically, the payoff is total profit
or total cost. These payoffs can be entered into a payoff table, which shows the amount for
each alternative if each possible event occurs. For 3 alternatives and 4 events, the table would
have 12 payoffs (3 × 4). If significant distortions will occur if the time value of money is not
recognized, the payoffs should be expressed as present values or internal rates of return (see
MyOMLab Supplement F.) For multiple criteria with important qualitative factors, use the
weighted scores of a preference matrix approach as the payoffs.

4.

Estimate the likelihood of each event, using past data, executive opinion, or other forecasting methods. Express it as a probability, making sure that the probabilities sum to 1.0. Develop probability estimates from past data if the past is considered a good indicator of the
future.

5.

Select a decision rule to evaluate the alternatives, such as choosing the alternative with the
lowest expected cost. The rule chosen depends on the amount of information the manager
has on the event probabilities and the manager’s attitudes toward risk.

payoff table
A table that shows the amount for
each alternative if each possible
event occurs.

MyOMLab

Using this process, we examine decisions under three different situations: certainty, uncertainty, and risk.

Decision Making under Certainty
The simplest situation is when the manager knows which event will occur. Here the decision rule
is to pick the alternative with the best payoff for the known event. The best alternative is the highest payoff if the payoffs are expressed as profits. If the payoffs are expressed as costs, the best alternative is the lowest payoff.

DECISION MAKING MODELS

EXAMPLE A.5

SUPPLEMENT A

Decisions under Certainty

A manager is deciding whether to build a small or a large facility. Much depends on the future demand that the
facility must serve, and demand may be small or large. The manager knows with certainty the payoffs that will
result under each alternative, shown in the following payoff table. The payoffs (in $000) are the present values of
future revenues minus costs for each alternative in each event.

High

Small facility

270

Large facility

800

0

0

Do nothing
What is the best choice if future demand will be low?

SOLUTION
In this example, the best choice is the one with the highest payoff. If the manager knows that future demand will
be low, the company should build a small facility and enjoy a payoff of $200,000. The larger facility has a payoff
of only $160,000. The “do nothing” alternative is dominated by the other alternatives; that is, the outcome of one
alternative is no better than the outcome of another alternative for each event. Because the “do nothing” alternative is dominated, the manager does not consider it further.
DECISION POINT
If management really knows future demand, it would build the small facility if demand will be low and the large
facility if demand will be high. If demand is uncertain, it should consider other decision rules.

Decision Making under Uncertainty
Here, we assume that the manager can list the possible events but cannot estimate their probabilities. Perhaps, a lack of prior experience makes it difficult for the firm to estimate probabilities. In
such a situation, the manager can use one of four decision rules:
1.

Maximin. Choose the alternative that is the “best of the worst.” This rule is for the pessimist,
who anticipates the “worst case” for each alternative.

2.

Maximax. Choose the alternative that is the “best of the best.” This rule is for the optimist who
has high expectations and prefers to “go for broke.”

3.

Laplace. Choose the alternative with the best weighted payoff. To find the weighted payoff,
give equal importance (or, alternatively, equal probability) to each event. If there are n events,
the importance (or probability) of each is 1/n, so they add up to 1.0. This rule is for the realist.

4. Minimax Regret. Choose the alternative with the best “worst regret.” Calculate a table of regrets
(or opportunity losses), in which the rows represent the alternatives and the columns represent
the events. A regret is the difference between a given payoff and the best payoff in the same column. For an event, it shows how much is lost by picking an alternative to the one that is best for
this event. The regret can be lost profit or increased cost, depending on the situation.

Large facility

0.5(160) + 0.5(800) = 480

The best of these weighted payoffs is $480,000, so the realist would build a large facility.
d.

Minimax Regret. If demand turns out to be low, the best alternative is a small facility and its
regret is 0 (or 200 − 200). If a large facility is built when demand turns out to be low, the regret is 40 (or
200 − 160).

The column on the right shows the worst regret for each alternative. To minimize the maximum regret, pick
a large facility. The biggest regret is associated with having only a small facility and high demand.
DECISION POINT
The pessimist would choose the small facility. The realist, optimist, and manager choosing to minimize the maximum regret would build the large facility.

Decision Making under Risk
Here we assume that the manager can list the events and estimate their probabilities. The
manager has less information than with decision making under certainty, but more information than with decision making under uncertainty. For this intermediate situation, the expected value decision rule is widely used (both in practice and in this book). The expected
value for an alternative is found by weighting each payoff with its associated probability and
then adding the weighted payoff scores. The alternative with the best expected value (highest
for profits and lowest for costs) is chosen.
This rule is much like the Laplace decision rule, except that the events are no longer assumed
to be equally likely (or equally important). The expected value is what the average payoff would
be if the decision could be repeated time after time. Of course, the expected value decision rule
can result in a bad outcome if the wrong event occurs. However, it gives the best results if applied
consistently over a long period of time. The rule should not be used if the manager is inclined to
avoid risk.

SOLUTION
The expected value for each alternative is as follows:

Small facility

0.4(200) + 0.6(270) = 242

Large facility

0.4(160) + 0.6(800) = 544

DECISION POINT
Management would choose a large facility if it used this expected value decision rule, because it provides the
best long-term results if consistently applied over time.

Decision Trees
The decision tree method is a general approach to a wide range of processes and supply chain
decisions, such as product planning, process analysis, process capacity, and location. It is particularly valuable for evaluating different capacity expansion alternatives when demand is uncertain and sequential decisions are involved. For example, a company may expand a facility in
2013 only to discover in 2016 that demand is much higher than forecasted. In that case, a second
decision may be necessary to determine whether to expand again or build a second facility.
A decision tree is a schematic model of alternatives available to the decision maker, along
with their possible consequences. The name derives from the tree-like appearance of the model.
It consists of a number of square nodes, representing decision points, which are left by branches
(which should be read from left to right), representing the alternatives. Branches leaving circular, or chance, nodes represent the events. The probability of each chance event, P(E), is shown
above each branch. The probabilities for all branches leaving a chance node must sum to 1.0.
The conditional payoff, which is the payoff for each possible alternative-event combination, is
shown at the end of each combination. Payoffs are given only at the outset, before the analysis
begins, for the end points of each alternative-event combination. In Figure A.4, for example,
payoff 1 is the financial outcome the manager expects if alternative 1 is chosen and then chance
event 1 occurs.
No payoff can be associated yet with any branches farther to the left, such as alternative 1
as a whole, because it is followed by a chance event and is not an end point. Payoffs often are

expressed as the present value of net profits. If revenues are not affected by the decision, the payoff is expressed as net costs.
After drawing a decision tree, we solve it by working from right to left, calculating the expected
payoff for each node as follows:
1.

For an event node, we multiply the payoff of each event branch by the event’s probability. We
add these products to get the event node’s expected payoff.

2.

For a decision node, we pick the alternative that has the best expected payoff. If an alternative
leads to an event node, its payoff is equal to that node’s expected payoff (already calculated).
We “saw off,” or “prune,” the other branches not chosen by marking two short lines through
them. The decision node’s expected payoff is the one associated with the single remaining
unpruned branch. We continue this process until the leftmost decision node is reached. The
unpruned branch extending from it is the best alternative to pursue. If multistage decisions
are involved, we must await subsequent events before deciding what to do next. If new probability or payoff estimates are obtained, we repeat the process.

Various software is available for drawing decision trees. PowerPoint can be used to draw decision trees, although it does not have the capability to analyze the decision tree. More extensive
capabilities, in addition to POM for Windows, are found with SmartDraw (www.smartdraw.com),
PrecisionTree decision analysis from Palisade Corporation (www.palisade.com), and TreePlan
(www.treeplan.com/treeplan.htm).

can be either low or high, with probabilities estimated to be 0.4 and 0.6, respectively. If a small facility is built
and demand proves to be high, the manager may choose not to expand (payoff = $223,000) or to expand
(payoff = $270,000). If a small facility is built and demand is low, there is no reason to expand and the payoff
is $200,000. If a large facility is built and demand proves to be low, the choice is to do nothing ($40,000) or to
stimulate demand through local advertising. The response to advertising may be either modest or sizable, with
their probabilities estimated to be 0.3 and 0.7, respectively. If it is modest, the payoff is estimated to be only
$20,000; the payoff grows to $220,000 if the response is sizable. Finally, if a large facility is built and demand
turns out to be high, the payoff is $800,000.
Draw a decision tree. Then analyze it to determine the expected payoff for each decision and event node.
Which alternative—building a small facility or building a large facility—has the higher expected payoff?
SOLUTION
The decision tree in Figure A.5 shows the event probability and the payoff for each of the seven alternativeevent combinations. The first decision is whether to build a small or a large facility. Its node is shown first, to
the left, because it is the decision the retailer must make now. The second decision node—whether to expand
at a later date—is reached only if a small facility is built and demand turns out to be high. Finally, the third
decision point—whether to advertise—is reached only if the retailer builds a large facility and demand turns
out to be low.
Analysis of the decision tree begins with calculation of the expected payoffs from right to left, shown on
Figure A.5 beneath the appropriate event and decision nodes.
1.

For the event node dealing with advertising, the expected payoff is 160, or the sum of each event’s
payoff weighted by its probability [0.3(20) + 0.7(220)].

2.

The expected payoff for decision node 3 is 160 because Advertise (160) is better than Do nothing
(40). Prune the Do nothing alternative.

3.

The payoff for decision node 2 is 270 because Expand (270) is better than Do not expand (223).
Prune Do not expand.

4.

The expected payoff for the event node dealing with demand, assuming that a small facility is
built, is 242 [or 0.4(200) + 0.6(270)].

5.

The expected payoff for the event node dealing with demand, assuming that a large facility is built,
is 544 [or 0.4(160) + 0.6(800)].

6.

The expected payoff for decision node 1 is 544 because the large facility’s expected payoff is
largest. Prune Small facility.

LEARNING GOALS IN REVIEW
 Explain break-even analysis, using both the graphic and alge-

braic approaches. The section “Evaluating Services and Products,” pp. 52–53, covers this analysis. Example A.1 and Solved
Problem 4 demonstrate both approaches. Example A.3 shows its
use in evaluating different processes.

 Define a preference matrix. See the section “Preference

Matrix,” pp. 55–56, for making decisions involving unquantifiable
factors, where some factors are rated more important than
others. Example A.4 and Solved Problem 1 demonstrate the
calculations.

 Explain how to construct a payoff table. The section “Decision

Theory,” pp. 56–58, begins with the construction of a payoff table
that shows the payoff for each feasible alternative and each
event. See the table in Example A.5.

 Identify the maximin, maximax, Laplace, minimax regret, and

expected value decision rules. The sections “Decision Making
under Uncertainty” and “Decision Making under Risk,” pp. 57–58,
cover these decision rules for when the outcomes associated
with alternatives are in doubt. Examples A.6 and A.7 demonstrate how these rules work, and so does Solved Problem 2.

 Describe how to draw and analyze a decision tree. The section

“Decision Trees,” pp. 59–61, show how to draw and analyze decision trees where several alternatives are available over time.
Example A.8 and Solved Problem 3 shows how to work back
from right to left, pruning as you go, until the best alternate is
found for decision node 1.

Adele Weiss manages the campus flower shop. Flowers must be ordered three days in advance
from her supplier in Mexico. Although Valentine’s Day is fast approaching, sales are almost
entirely last-minute, impulse purchases. Advance sales are so small that Weiss has no way
to estimate the probability of low (25 dozen), medium (60 dozen), or high (130 dozen) demand for red roses on the big day. She buys roses for $15 per dozen and sells them for $40 per
dozen. Construct a payoff table. Which decision is indicated by each of the following decision

a.

Under the minimax regret criteria, Weiss should order 130 dozen. The maximum regret
of ordering 25 dozen occurs if demand is high: $3,250 − $625 = $2,625. The maximum
regret of ordering 60 dozen occurs if demand is high: $3,250 − $1,500 = $1,750. The
maximum regret of ordering 130 dozen occurs if demand is low: $625 − (−$950) = $1,575.

b.

Under the maximax criteria, Weiss should order 130 dozen. The greatest possible payoff,
$3,250, is associated with the largest order.

c.

Under the Laplace criteria, Weiss should order 60 dozen. Equally weighted payoffs for
ordering 25, 60, and 130 dozen are about $625, $1,033, and $917, respectively.

d.

Under the maximin criteria, Weiss should order 25 dozen, because if demand is low, Weiss’s
profits are $625, the best of the worst payoffs.

Solved Problem 3
White Valley Ski Resort is planning the ski lift operation for its new ski resort. Management is trying to determine whether one or two lifts will be necessary; each lift can accommodate 250 people
per day. Skiing normally occurs in the 14-week period from December to April, during which the
lift will operate 7 days per week. The first lift will operate at 90 percent capacity if economic conditions are bad, the probability of which is believed to be about a 0.3. During normal times the first
lift will be utilized at 100 percent capacity, and the excess crowd will provide 50 percent utilization
of the second lift. The probability of normal times is 0.5. Finally, if times are really good, the probability of which is 0.2, the utilization of the second lift will increase to 90 percent. The equivalent
annual cost of installing a new lift, recognizing the time value of money and the lift’s economic
life, is $50,000. The annual cost of installing two lifts is only $90,000 if both are purchased at the
same time. If used at all, each lift costs $200,000 to operate, no matter how low or high its utilization rate. Lift tickets cost $20 per customer per day.
Should the resort purchase one lift or two?
SOLUTION
The decision tree is shown in Figure A.6. The payoff ($000) for each alternative-event branch is
shown in the following table. The total revenues from one lift operating at 100 percent capacity are
$490,000 (or 250 customers × 98 days × $20/customer-day).

Solved Problem 4
The owner of a small manufacturing business has patented a new device for washing dishes and
cleaning dirty kitchen sinks. Before trying to commercialize the device and add it to his or her existing product line, the owner wants reasonable assurance of success. Variable costs are estimated

Tri-County G&T sells 140,000 MWh per year of electrical
power to Boulder at $70 per MWh, has fixed costs of $83.2

A news clipping service is considering modernization.
Rather than manually clipping and photocopying articles
of interest and mailing them to its clients, employees

electronically input stories from most widely circulated publications into a database. Each new issue is
searched for key words, such as a client’s company name,
competitors’ names, type of business, and the company’s products, services, and officers. When matches
occur, affected clients are instantly notified via an online network. If the story is of interest, it is electronically
transmitted, so the client often has the story and can
prepare comments for follow-up interviews before the
publication hits the street. The manual process has fixed
costs of $400,000 per year and variable costs of $6.20 per
clipping mailed. The price charged the client is $8.00 per
clipping. The computerized process has fixed costs of
$1,300,000 per year and variable costs of $2.25 per story
electronically transmitted to the client.
a. If the same price is charged for either process, what is
the annual volume beyond which the automated process is more attractive?
b. The present volume of business is 225,000 clippings
per year. Many of the clippings sent with the current
process are not of interest to the client or are multiple copies of the same story appearing in several
publications. The news clipping service believes that

Techno Corporation is currently manufacturing an item
at variable costs of $4 per unit. Annual fixed costs of
manufacturing this item are $141,000. The current selling
price of the item is $11 per unit, and the annual sales volume is 35,000 units.
a. Techno can substantially improve the item’s quality
by installing new equipment at additional annual fixed
costs of $65,000. Variable costs per unit would increase
by $1, but, as more of the better-quality product could
be sold, the annual volume would increase to 55,000
units. Should Techno buy the new equipment and
maintain the current price of the item? Why or
why not?
b. Alternatively, Techno could increase the selling price
to $13 per unit. However, the annual sales volume
would be limited to 45,000 units. Should Techno buy
the new equipment and raise the price of the item?
Why or why not?

A product at the Jennings Company enjoyed reasonable
sales volumes, but its contributions to profits were disappointing. Last year, 17,500 units were produced and sold.
The selling price is $22 per unit, the variable cost is $18

a. What is the percent change in the per-unit profit
contribution generated by each alternative in
part (d)?
b. Jennings is considering ways to either stimulate sales
volume or decrease variable cost. Management believes that either sales can be increased by 30 percent
or that variable cost can be reduced to 85 percent of
its current level. Which alternative leads to higher
contributions to profits, assuming that each is equally
costly to implement? (Hint: Calculate profits for both
alternatives and identify the one having the greatest

The Tri-County Generation and Transmission Association is a nonprofit cooperative organization that
provides electrical service to rural customers. Based
on a faulty long-range demand forecast, Tri-County
overbuilt its generation and distribution system. TriCounty now has much more capacity than it needs to
serve its customers. Fixed costs, mostly debt service
on investment in plant and equipment, are $89.2 million per year. Variable costs, mostly fossil fuel costs,
are $29 per megawatt-hour (MWh, or million watts of
power used for one hour). The new person in charge of
demand forecasting prepared a short-range forecast for
use in next year’s budgeting process. That forecast calls
for Tri-County customers to consume 2 million MWh of
energy next year.
a. How much will Tri-County need to charge its customers per MWh to break even next year?
b. The Tri-County customers balk at that price and conserve electrical energy. Only 96 percent of forecasted
demand materializes. What is the resulting surplus or
loss for this nonprofit organization?

8. A restaurant is considering adding fresh brook trout
to its menu. Customers would have the choice of
catching their own trout from a simulated mountain
stream or simply asking the waiter to net the trout for
them. Operating the stream would require $9,600 in fixed
costs per year. Variable costs are estimated to be $6.10 per
trout. The firm wants to break even if 800 trout dinners are
sold per year. What should be the price of the new item?

Hahn Manufacturing purchases a key component of
one of its products from a local supplier. The current
purchase price is $1,500 per unit. Efforts to standardize
parts succeeded to the point that this same component
can now be used in five different products. Annual component usage should increase from 150 to 750 units.
Management wonders whether it is time to make the
component in-house, rather than to continue buying it
from the supplier. Fixed costs would increase by about
$40,000 per year for the new equipment and tooling
needed. The cost of raw materials and variable overhead
would be about $1,100 per unit, and labor costs would be
$300 per unit produced.
a. Should Hahn make rather than buy?
b. What is the break-even quantity?
c. What other considerations might be important?

10. Earthquake, drought, fire, economic famine, flood, and
a pestilence of TV court reporters have caused an exodus

reduced to buying 300,000 MWh of electric power from
Tri-County G&T at a price of $79 per MWh, or refurbishing and recommissioning the abandoned Pearl Street
Power Station in downtown Boulder. Fixed costs of that
project are $7 million per year, and variable costs would
be $50 per MWh. Should Boulder build or buy?
11. Mary Williams, owner of Williams Products, is evaluating

DECISION THEORY AND DECISION TREE
15. A manufacturing plant has reached full capacity. The company must build a second plant—either small or large—at
a nearby location. The demand is likely to be high or low.
The probability of low demand is 0.3. If demand is low, the
large plant has a present value of $5 million and the small
plant, a present value of $8 million. If demand is high, the
large plant pays off with a present value of $18 million and
the small plant with a present value of only $10 million.
However, the small plant can be expanded later if demand
proves to be high, for a present value of $14 million.
a. Draw a decision tree for this problem.

average. If demand is high, the medium-sized facility is
expected to earn a net present value of $150,000; it can be
expanded to a large size for a net payoff of $145,000.
If a large facility is built and demand is high, earnings
are expected to be $220,000. If demand is average for the
large facility, the present value is expected to be $125,000;
if demand is low, the facility is expected to lose $60,000.

17. A manager is trying to decide whether to buy one machine
or two. If only one is purchased and demand proves to be
excessive, the second machine can be purchased later.
Some sales will be lost, however, because the lead time for
producing this type of machine is six months. In addition,
the cost per machine will be lower if both are purchased
at the same time. The probability of low demand is estimated to be 0.30. The after-tax net present value of the
benefits from purchasing the two machines together is
$90,000 if demand is low and $180,000 if demand is high.
If one machine is purchased and demand is low, the
net present value is $110,000. If demand is high, the manager has three options. Doing nothing has a net present
value of $100,000; subcontracting, $140,000; and buying
the second machine, $120,000.
a. Draw a decision tree for this problem.
b. How many machines should the company buy
initially? What is the expected payoff for this
alternative?
18. A manager is trying to decide whether to build a small,
medium, or large facility. Demand can be low, average,
or high, with the estimated probabilities being 0.25, 0.40,
and 0.35, respectively.
A small facility is expected to earn an after-tax net
present value of just $18,000 if demand is low. If demand
is average, the small facility is expected to earn $75,000;
it can be increased to medium size to earn a net present
value of $60,000. If demand is high, the small facility is expected to earn $75,000 and can be expanded to medium
size to earn $60,000 or to large size to earn $125,000.
A medium-sized facility is expected to lose an estimated
$25,000 if demand is low and earn $140,000 if demand is

19. Build-Rite Construction has received favorable publicity
from guest appearances on a public TV home improvement program. Public TV programming decisions seem to
be unpredictable, so Build-Rite cannot estimate the probability of continued benefits from its relationship with the
show. Demand for home improvements next year may
be either low or high. But Build-Rite must decide now
whether to hire more employees, do nothing, or develop
subcontracts with other home improvement contractors.
Build-Rite has developed the following payoff table:

20 . Benjamin Moses, chief engineer of Offshore Chemicals,
Inc., must decide whether to build a new processing
facility based on an experimental technology. If the new
facility works, the company will realize a net profit of
$20 million. If the new facility fails, the company will
lose $10 million. Benjamin’s best guess is that there is a
40 percent chance that the new facility will work.
What decision should Benjamin Moses make?
