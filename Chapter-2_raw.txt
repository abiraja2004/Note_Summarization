XBOX 360
our years after the introduction of Xbox, Microsoft needed to quickly design,
develop, and produce a new product. Sony’s PlayStation 2 was dominating
the video game market and Microsoft needed a new product to compete
with the impending release of PlayStation 3. Developing such a product is a
project of massive proportions. The project consisted of four phases: (1) design,
(2) analysis, (3) development, and (4) launch. The result was Xbox 360.

F

Design
The design of the Xbox 360 was a collaborative effort between Microsoft and
many other firms, including Astro Studios in San Francisco, which designed the
overall console and controller; IBM, which designed the processor chip; ATI,
which designed the graphics chip; and a host of game design firms to develop
games for the new product. A key element of the new product was the built-in
Internet access that allowed gamers to access online games, buy game add-ons,
and access multiplayer games developed exclusively for Xbox 360. Microsoft
also included its primary manufacturers, Flextronics and Wistron, in the design
process to optimize the production and assembly of the more than 1,000 parts
contained in an Xbox 360.

Analysis
Getting an estimate of future sales for a new product is always difficult; however, in this case, the historic patterns for PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2, and Xbox

were useful. Analysts found that the peak year for a PlayStation product was
4 years after its introduction and that the life cycle for those products is about
11 years. This information provided a basis for estimating the sales potential of
Xbox 360, although actual sales may be limited due to supply constraints. Nonetheless, Microsoft realized that the potential was there to open a new generation
of game consoles well ahead of the market.

Development
Microsoft worked closely with Flextronics, Wistron, and the various design firms
to iron out manufacturing problems in the early phases of Xbox 360 production.
Once initial production was underway, Microsoft brought on Celestica to add production capacity. The decision was made to focus manufacturing operations in
China. All told, 10,000 workers in China would be involved in Xbox 360 production.

Launch
Microsoft’s Xbox 360 gained an early lead in terms of market share due, in part,
to its early launch date, which was one year ahead of its rivals PlayStation 3 and
Wii. All told, the product was released in 36 countries in the first year of production, a Herculean effort requiring extensive coordination and a high level of
project management skill. Sales of the Xbox 360 exceeded expectations with
more than 10 million units sold in the first year alone. Nonetheless, Microsoft
experienced difficulties in getting the supply chain to meet customer demands in
a timely fashion. The lesson to be learned is that projects can be planned and executed properly; however, the underlying infrastructure that delivers the product
is equally important in the ultimate success of the venture.

Companies such as Microsoft are experts at managing projects such as Xbox 360. They
master the ability to schedule activities and monitor progress within strict time, cost, and performance guidelines. A project is an interrelated set of activities with a definite starting and ending
point, which results in a unique outcome for a specific allocation of resources.
Projects are common in everyday life as well as in business. Planning weddings, remodeling
bathrooms, writing term papers, and organizing surprise parties are examples of small projects in
everyday life. Conducting company audits, planning mergers, creating advertising campaigns, reengineering processes, developing new services or products, and establishing a strategic alliance
are examples of large projects in business.

MANAGING EFFECTIVE PROJECTS

The three main goals of any project are (1) complete the project on time or earlier, (2) do not
exceed the budget, and (3) meet the specifications to the satisfaction of the customer. When we
must undertake projects with some uncertainty involved, it does not hurt to have flexibility with
respect to resource availability, deadlines, and budgets. Consequently, projects can be complex
and challenging to manage. Project management, which is a systemized, phased approach to defining, organizing, planning, monitoring, and controlling projects, is one way to overcome that
challenge.
Projects often cut across organizational lines because they need the skills of multiple professions and organizations. Furthermore, each project is unique, even if it is routine, requiring new combinations of skills and resources in the project process. For example, projects for
adding a new branch office, installing new computers in a department, or developing a sales
promotion may be initiated several times a year. Each project may have been done many times
before; however, differences arise with each replication. Uncertainties, such as the advent of
new technologies or the activities of competitors, can change the character of projects and require responsive countermeasures. Finally, projects are temporary because personnel, materials, and facilities are organized to complete them within a specified time frame and then are
disbanded.
Projects, and the application of project management, facilitate the implementation of strategy. However, the power of this approach goes beyond the focus on one project. Operations strategy initiatives often require the coordination of many interdependent projects. Such a collection
of projects is called a program, which is an interdependent set of projects with a common strategic purpose. As new project proposals come forward, management must assess their fit to the
current operations strategy and ongoing initiatives and have a means to prioritize them because
funds for projects are often limited. Projects can be also used to implement changes to processes
and supply chains. For example, projects involving the implementation of major information
technologies may affect all of a firm’s core processes and supporting processes as well as some of
their suppliers’ and customers’ processes. As such, projects are a useful tool for improving processes and supply chains.

Project Management across the Organization
Even though a project may be under the overall purview of a single department, other departments likely should be involved in the project. For example, consider an information systems
project to develop a corporate customer database at a bank. Many of the bank’s customers are
large corporations that require services spanning several departments at the bank. Because no
department at the bank knows exactly what services a corporate customer is receiving from
other departments, the project would consolidate information about corporate customers from
many areas of the bank into one database. From this information, corporate banking services
could be designed not only to better serve the corporate customers, but also to provide a basis
for evaluating the prices that the bank charges. Marketing is interested in knowing all the services a customer is receiving so that it can package and sell other services that the customer
may not be aware of. Finance is interested in how profitable a customer is to the bank and
whether the provided services are appropriately priced. The project team, led by the information systems department, should consist of representatives from the marketing and finance departments who have a direct interest in corporate clients. All departments in a firm benefit from
sound project management practices, even if the projects remain within the purview of a single
department.

Defining and Organizing Projects
A clear understanding of a project’s organization and how personnel are going to work together
to complete the project are keys to success. In this section, we will address (1) defining the scope
and objectives, (2) selecting the project manager and team, and (3) recognizing the organizational
structure.

Defining the Scope and Objectives of a Project
A thorough statement of a project’s scope, time frame, and allocated resources is essential to managing the project. This statement is often referred to as the project objective statement. The scope
provides a succinct statement of project objectives and captures the essence of the desired project

outcomes in the form of major deliverables, which are concrete outcomes of the project. Changes
to the scope of a project inevitably increase costs and delay completion. Collectively, changes to
scope are called scope creep and, in sufficient quantity, are primary causes of failed projects. The
time frame for a project should be as specific as possible, as in “the project should be completed
by January 1, 2014.” Finally, although specifying an allocation of resources to a project may be
difficult during the early stages of planning, it is important for managing the project. The allocation should be expressed as a dollar figure or as full-time equivalents of personnel time. A specific
statement of allocated resources makes it possible to make adjustments to the scope of the project
as it proceeds.

Selecting the Project Manager and Team
Once the project is selected, a project manager must be chosen. The qualities of a good project
manager should be well aligned with the roles a project manager must play.
 Facilitator. The project manager often must resolve conflicts between individuals or departments to ensure that the project has the appropriate resources for the job to be completed.
Successful project managers have good leadership skills and a systems view, which encompasses the interaction of the project, its resources, and its deliverables with the firm as a
whole.
 Communicator. Project progress and requests for additional resources must be clearly communicated to senior management and other stakeholders in a project. The project manager
must also frequently communicate with the project team to get the best performance.
 Decision Maker. Good project managers will be sensitive to the way the team performs best
and be ready to make tough decisions, if necessary. The project manger must organize the
team meetings, specify how the team will make decisions, and determine the nature and timing of reports to senior management.
Selecting the project team is just as important as the selection of the project manager. Several
characteristics should be considered.
 Technical Competence. Team members should have the technical competence required for
the tasks to which they will be assigned.
 Sensitivity. All team members should be sensitive to interpersonal conflicts that may arise. Senior team members should be politically sensitive to help mitigate problems with upper-level
management.
 Dedication. Team members should feel comfortable solving project problems that may spill
over into areas outside their immediate expertise. They should also be dedicated to getting
the project done, as opposed to maintaining a comfortable work schedule.

Recognizing Organizational Structure
The relationship of the project manager to the project team is determined by the firm’s organizational structure. Each of the three types of organizational structure described below has its own
implications for project management.
 Functional. The project is housed in a specific department or functional area, presumably
the one with the most interest in the project. Assistance from personnel in other functional
areas must be negotiated by the project manager. In such cases, the project manager has less
control over project timing than if the entire scope of the project fell within the purview of the
department.
 Pure Project. The team members work exclusively for the project manager on a particular
project. This structure simplifies the lines of authority and is particularly effective for large
projects that consist of enough work for each team member to work full time. For small projects, it could result in significant duplication of resources across functional areas.
 Matrix. The matrix structure is a compromise between the functional and pure project structures. The project managers of the firm’s projects all report to a “program manager” who
coordinates resource and technological needs across the functional boundaries. The matrix
structure allows each functional area to maintain control over who works on a project and
the technology that is used. However, team members, in effect, have two bosses: the project
manager and the department manager. Resolving these “line of authority” conflicts requires a
strong project manager.

MANAGING EFFECTIVE PROJECTS

The construction of the 2012 Olympic Stadium in Stratford, East London, required the coordination of materials,
equipment, and personnel. Project management techniques played a major role.

Planning Projects
After the project is defined and organized, the team must formulate a plan that identifies the
specific work to be accomplished and a schedule for completion. Planning projects involves five
steps: (1) defining the work breakdown structure, (2) diagramming the network, (3) developing the
schedule, (4) analyzing cost–time trade-offs, and (5) assessing risks.

Defining the Work Breakdown Structure
The work breakdown structure (WBS) is a statement of all work that has to be completed. Perhaps,
the single most important contributor to delay is the omission of work that is germane to the successful completion of the project. The project manager must work closely with the team to identify all activities. An activity is the smallest unit of work effort consuming both time and resources
that the project manager can schedule and control. Typically, in the process of accumulating activities, the team generates a hierarchy to the work breakdown. Major work components are broken
down to smaller tasks that ultimately are broken down to activities that are assigned to individuals.
Figure 2.1 shows a WBS for a major project involving the relocation of a hospital. In the interest of
better serving the surrounding community, the board of St. John’s Hospital has decided to move
to a new location. The project involves constructing a new hospital and making it operational. The
work components at level 1 in the WBS can be broken down into smaller units of work in level 2 that
could be further divided at level 3, until the project manager gets to activities at a level of detail that
can be scheduled and controlled. For example, “Organizing and Site Preparation” has been divided
into six activities at level 2 in Figure 2.1. We have kept our example simple so that the concept of
the WBS can be easily understood. If our activities in the example are divided into even smaller
units of work, it is easy to see that the total WBS for a project of this size may include many more
than 100 activities. Regardless of the project, care must be taken to include all important activities
in the WBS to avoid project delays. Often overlooked are the activities required to plan the project,
get management approval at various stages, run pilot tests of new services or products, and prepare
final reports.
Each activity in the WBS must have an “owner” who is responsible for doing the work. Activity
ownership avoids confusion in the execution of activities and assigns responsibility for timely completion. The team should have a defined procedure for assigning activities to team members, which
can be democratic (consensus of the team) or autocratic (assigned by the project manager).

Network planning methods can help managers monitor and control projects. These methods treat
a project as a set of interrelated activities that can be visually displayed in a network diagram,
which consists of nodes (circles) and arcs (arrows) that depict the relationships between activities. Two network planning methods were developed in the 1950s. The program evaluation and
review technique (PERT) was created for the U.S. Navy’s Polaris missile project, which involved
3,000 separate contractors and suppliers. The critical path method (CPM) was developed as a
means of scheduling maintenance shutdowns at chemical-processing plants. Although early versions of PERT and CPM differed in their treatment of activity time estimates, today the differences
are minor. For purposes of our discussion, we refer to them collectively as PERT/CPM. These
methods offer several benefits to project managers, including the following:
1.

Considering projects as networks forces project teams to identify and organize the data required and to identify the interrelationships between activities. This process also provides a
forum for managers of different functional areas to discuss the nature of the various activities
and their resource requirements.

2.

Networks enable project managers to estimate the completion time of projects, an advantage
that can be useful in planning other events and in conducting contractual negotiations with
customers and suppliers.

3.

Reports highlight the activities that are crucial to completing projects on schedule. They also
highlight the activities that may be delayed without affecting completion dates, thereby freeing up resources for other, more critical activities.

4.

Network methods enable project managers to analyze the time and cost implications of
resource trade-offs.

critical path method (CPM)
A network planning method developed in the 1950s as a means

Diagramming the project network involves establishing precedence relationships and estimating activity times.
precedence relationship
A relationship that determines a
sequence for undertaking activities; it specifies that one activity
cannot start until a preceding
activity has been completed.

Establishing Precedence Relationships A precedence relationship determines a sequence
for undertaking activities; it specifies that one activity cannot start until a preceding activity has
been completed. For example, brochures announcing a conference for executives must first be
designed by the program committee (activity A) before they can be printed (activity B). In other
words, activity A must precede activity B. For large projects, establishing precedence relationships
is essential because incorrect or omitted precedence relationships will result in costly delays. The
precedence relationships are represented by a network diagram.

MANAGING EFFECTIVE PROJECTS

Estimating Activity Times When the same type of activity has been done many times before, time
estimates will have a relatively high degree of certainty. Several ways can be used to get time estimates in such an environment. First, statistical methods can be used if the project team has access
to data on actual activity times experienced in the past (see MyOMLab Supplement H, “Measuring Output Rates,”). Second, if activity times improve with the number of replications, the times
can be estimated using learning curve models (see Supplement I, “Learning Curve Analysis,” in
MyOMLab). Finally, the times for first-time activities are often estimated using managerial opinions based on similar prior experiences (see Chapter 14, “Forecasting Demand”). If the estimates
involve a high degree of uncertainty, probability distributions for activity times can be used. We
discuss how to incorporate uncertainty in project networks when we address risk assessment later
in this chapter. For now, we assume that the activity times are known with certainty.
Using the Activity-On-Node Approach

The diagramming approach we use in this text is referred
to as the activity-on-node (AON) network, in which nodes represent activities and arcs represent
the precedence relationships between them. Some diagramming conventions must be used for
AON networks. In cases of multiple activities with no predecessors, it is usual to show them emanating from a common node called start. For multiple activities with no successors, it is usual to
show them connected to a node called finish. Figure 2.2 shows how to diagram several commonly
encountered activity relationships.

CHAPTER 2

77

Developing the Schedule
A key advantage of network planning methods is the creation of a schedule of project activities that will help managers achieve the objectives of the project. Managers can (1) estimate the
completion time of a project by finding the critical path, (2) identify the start and finish times for
each activity for a project schedule, and (3) calculate the amount of slack time for each activity.

Critical Path A crucial aspect of project management is estimating the time of completion of a
project. If each activity in relocating the hospital were done in sequence, with work proceeding on
only one activity at a time, the time of completion would equal the sum of the times for all the activities, or 175 weeks. However, Figure 2.3 indicates that some activities can be carried on simultaneously given adequate resources. We call each sequence of activities between the project’s start
and finish a path. The network describing the hospital relocation project has five paths: (1) A–I–K,
(2) A–F–K, (3) A–C–G–J–K, (4) B–D–H–J–K, and (5) B–E–J–K. The critical path is the sequence of
activities between a project’s start and finish that takes the longest time to complete. Thus, the
activities along the critical path determine the completion time of the project; that is, if one of the
activities on the critical path is delayed, the entire project will be delayed. The estimated times for
the paths in the hospital project network are

earliest finish time (EF)

The activity string B–D–H–J–K is estimated to take 69 weeks to complete. As the longest, it
constitutes the critical path. Because the critical path defines the completion time of the project,
Judy Kramer and the project team should focus on these activities and any other path that is close
in length to the critical path.

Project Schedule

The typical objective is to finish the project as early as possible as determined
by the critical path. The project schedule is specified by the start and finish times for each activity. For any activity, managers can use the earliest start and finish times, the latest start and finish
times (and still finish the project on time), or times in between these extremes.
 Earliest Start and Earliest Finish Times The earliest start and earliest finish times are obtained as follows:
1. The earliest finish time (EF) of an activity equals its earliest start time plus its estimated
duration, t, or EF = ES + t .
The earliest start time (ES) for an activity is the earliest finish time of the immediately preceding activity. For
activities with more than one preceding activity, ES is the
latest of the earliest finish times of the preceding activities.
To calculate the duration of the entire project, we determine the EF for the last activity on the critical path.

An activity’s earliest start time
plus its estimated duration, t, or
EF = ES + t.
earliest start time (ES)
The earliest finish time of the
immediately preceding activity.
latest finish time (LF)
The latest start time of the activity
that immediately follows.
latest start time (LS)
The latest finish time minus its estimated duration, t, or LS = LF – t.

1. The latest finish time (LF) for an activity is the latest start
time of the activity that immediately follows. For activities
with more than one activity that immediately follow, LF is
the earliest of the latest start times of those activities.
2. The latest start time (LS) for an activity equals its latest
finish time minus its estimated duration, t, or LS = LF - t.

George Hall/Corbis

 Latest Start and Latest Finish Times To obtain the latest start
and latest finish times, we must work backward from the finish
node. We start by setting the latest finish time of the project
equal to the earliest finish time of the last activity on the critical path.

Aircraft construction is an example of a large project that requires a
sound project schedule because of the capital involved. Here several
747s are under construction at Boeing’s plant in Everett, Washington.

EXAMPLE 2.2

Calculating Start and Finish Times for the Activities
Calculate the ES, EF, LS, and LF times for each activity in the hospital project. Which activity should Kramer start
immediately? Figure 2.3 contains the activity times.
SOLUTION
To compute the early start and early finish times, we begin at the start node at time zero. Because activities
A and B have no predecessors, the earliest start times for these activities are also zero. The earliest finish times
for these activities are
EF A = 0 + 12 = 12 and EF B = 0 + 9 = 9
Because the earliest start time for activities I, F, and C is the earliest finish time of activity A,
ESI = 12, ESF = 12, and ESC = 12
Similarly,
ESD = 9 and ESE = 9
After placing these ES values on the network diagram (see Figure 2.4), we determine the EF times for activities
I, F, C, D, and E:
EFI = 12 + 15 = 27, EFF = 12 + 10 = 22, EFC = 12 + 10 = 22,
EFD = 9 + 10 = 19, and EFE = 9 + 24 = 33
The earliest start time for activity G is the latest EF time of all immediately preceding activities. Thus,
ESG = EFC = 22, ESH = EFD = 19
EFG = ESG + t = 22 + 35 = 57, EFH = ESH + t = 19 + 40 = 59

CHAPTER 2

The project team can now determine the earliest time any activity can be started. Because activity J has
several predecessors, the earliest time that activity J can begin is the latest of the EF times of any of its preceding activities: EFG , EFH, or EFE. Thus, EFJ = 59 + 4 = 63. Similarly, ESK = 63 and EFK = 63 + 6 = 69.
Because activity K is the last activity on the critical path, the earliest the project can be completed is week 69.
The earliest start and finish times for all activities are shown in Figure 2.4.
To compute the latest start and latest finish times, we begin by setting the latest finish activity time of
activity K at week 69, which is its earliest finish time as determined in Figure 2.4. Thus, the latest start time for
activity K is
LSK = LFK - t = 69 - 6 = 63
If activity K is to start no later than week 63, all its predecessors must finish no later than that time. Consequently,
LFI = 63, LFF = 63, and LFJ = 63
The latest start times for these activities are shown in Figure 2.4 as
LSI = 63 - 15 = 48, LSF = 63 - 10 = 53, and LSJ = 63 - 4 = 59
After obtaining LSJ, we can calculate the latest start times for the immediate predecessors of activity J:
LSG = 59 - 35 = 24, LSH = 59 - 40 = 19, and LSE = 59 - 24 = 35
Similarly, we can now calculate the latest start times for activities C and D:
LSC = 24 - 10 = 14 and LSD = 19 - 10 = 9
Activity A has more than one immediately following activity: I, F, and C. The earliest of the latest start times is 14
for activity C. Thus,
LSA = 14 - 12 = 2
Similarly, activity B has two immediate followers: D and E. Because the earliest of the latest start times of these
activities is 9,
LSB = 9 - 9 = 0
DECISION POINT
The earliest or latest start times can be used for developing a project schedule. For example, Kramer should
start activity B immediately because the latest start time is 0; otherwise, the project will not be completed by
week 69. When the LS is greater than the ES for an activity, that activity could be scheduled for any date
between ES and LS. Such is the case for activity E, which could be scheduled to start anytime between week 9
and week 35, depending on the availability of resources. The earliest start and earliest finish times and the latest
start and latest finish times for all activities are shown in Figure 2.4.

Activity Slack

The maximum length of time that an activity can be delayed without delaying the
entire project is called activity slack. Consequently, activities on the critical path have zero slack.
Information on slack can be useful because it highlights activities that need close attention. In this
regard, activity slack is the amount of schedule slippage that can be tolerated for an activity before
the entire project will be delayed. Slack at an activity is reduced when the estimated time duration of an activity is exceeded or when the scheduled start time for the activity must be delayed
because of resource considerations. Activity slack can be calculated in one of two ways for any
activity:

activity slack
The maximum length of time that
an activity can be delayed without delaying the entire project,
calculated as S = LS – ES or
S = LF – EF.

S = LS - ES or S = LF - EF
Computers calculate activity slack and prepare periodic reports for large projects, enabling
managers to monitor progress. Using these reports, managers can sometimes manipulate slack
to overcome scheduling problems. When resources can be used on several different activities
in a project, they can be taken from activities with slack and given to activities that are behind
schedule until the slack is used up. The slack for each activity in the hospital project is shown in
Figure 2.4.

estimated duration times, on a time line. The resulting diagram is called a Gantt chart. Figure 2.5
shows a Gantt chart for the hospital project created with Microsoft Project, a popular software
package for project management. The critical path is shown in red. The chart clearly shows which
activities can be undertaken simultaneously and when they should be started. Figure 2.5 also
shows the earliest start schedule for the project. Microsoft Project can also be used to show the latest start schedule or to change the definition of the work week to declare Saturday and Sunday as
work days, for example. Gantt charts are popular because they are intuitive and easy to construct.

Analyzing Cost–Time Trade-Offs

Keeping costs at acceptable levels is almost always as important as meeting schedule dates. In this
section, we discuss the use of PERT/CPM methods to obtain minimum-cost schedules.
The reality of project management is that there are always cost–time trade-offs. For example, a project can often
be completed earlier than scheduled by hiring more workers
or running extra shifts. Such actions could be advantageous
if savings or additional revenues accrue from completing the
project early. Total project costs are the sum of direct costs,
indirect costs, and penalty costs. These costs are dependent either on activity times or on project completion time.
Direct costs include labor, materials, and any other costs
directly related to project activities. Indirect costs include
administration, depreciation, financial, and other variable
overhead costs that can be avoided by reducing total project
time: The shorter the duration of the project, the lower the
indirect costs will be. Finally, a project may incur penalty
costs if it extends beyond some specific date, whereas an incentive may be provided for early completion. Managers can
shorten individual activity times by using additional direct
resources, such as overtime, personnel, or equipment. Thus,
a project manager may consider crashing, or expediting,

and total project costs.

CHAPTER 2

Cost to Crash To assess the benefit of crashing certain activities—from
either a cost or a schedule perspective—the project manager needs to
know the following times and costs:

8000

1.

The normal time (NT) is the time necessary to complete an activity
under normal conditions.

7000

2.

The normal cost (NC) is the activity cost associated with the normal time.
The crash time (CT) is the shortest possible time to complete
an activity.

4.

The crash cost (CC) is the activity cost associated with the
crash time.

costs increase by a proportional amount. For example, suppose that the
normal time for activity C in the hospital project is 10 weeks and is associ(Crash time)
ated with a direct cost of $4,000. Also, suppose that we can crash its time
to only 5 weeks at a total cost of $7,000; the net time reduction is 5 weeks
at a net cost increase of $3,000. We assume that crashing activity C costs
$3,000>5 = $600 per week—an assumption of linear marginal costs that is illustrated in Figure 2.6.
Thus, if activity C were expedited by 2 weeks (i.e., its time reduced from 10 weeks to 8 weeks), the
estimated direct costs would be $4,000 + 21$6002 = $5,200. For any activity, the cost to crash an
activity by one week is

Minimizing Costs The objective of cost analysis is to determine the project schedule that minimizes total project costs. Suppose that project indirect costs are $8,000 per week. Suppose also
that, after week 65, the Regional Hospital Board imposes on St. John’s a penalty cost of $20,000
per week if the hospital is not fully operational. With a critical path completion time of 69 weeks,
the hospital faces potentially large penalty costs unless the schedule is changed. For every week
that the project is shortened—to week 65—the hospital saves one week of penalty and indirect

costs, or $28,000. For reductions beyond week 65, the savings are only the weekly indirect costs
of $8,000.
The minimum possible project duration can be found by using the crash times of each activity for scheduling purposes. However, the cost of that schedule could be prohibitive. Project
managers are most interested in minimizing the costs of their projects so that budgets are not
exceeded. In determining the minimum-cost schedule, we start with the normal time schedule
and crash activities along the critical path, whose length equals the length of the project. We want
to determine how much we can add in crash costs without exceeding the savings in indirect and
penalty costs. The procedure involves the following steps:
Step 1. Determine the project’s critical path(s).
Step 2. Find the activity or activities on the critical path(s) with the lowest cost of crashing per week.
Step 3. Reduce the time for this activity until (a) it cannot be further reduced, (b) another path
becomes critical, or (c) the increase in direct costs exceeds the indirect and penalty cost
savings that result from shortening the project. If more than one path is critical, the time
for an activity on each path may have to be reduced simultaneously.
Step 4. Repeat this procedure until the increase in direct costs is larger than the savings generated
by shortening the project.

SOLUTION
The projected completion time of the project is 69 weeks. The project costs for that schedule are $1,992,000
in direct costs, 691$8,0002 = $552,000 in indirect costs, and 169 - 652 1$20,0002 = $80,000 in penalty
costs, for total project costs of $2,624,000. The five paths in the network have the following normal times:
A–I–K:

33 weeks

A–F–K:

28 weeks

A–C–G–J–K:

67 weeks

B–D–H–J–K:

69 weeks

B–E–J–K:

43 weeks

It will simplify our analysis if we can eliminate some paths from further consideration. If all activities on A–C–G–J–K
were crashed, the path duration would be 47 weeks. Crashing all activities on B–D–H–J–K results in a project
duration of 56 weeks. Because the normal times of A–I–K, A–F–K, and B–E–J–K are less than the minimum
times of the other two paths, we can disregard those three paths; they will never become critical regardless of
the crashing we may do.
STAGE 1
Step 1. The critical path is B–D–H–J–K.
Step 2. The cheapest activity to crash per week is J at $1,000, which is much less than the savings in indirect
and penalty costs of $28,000 per week.
Step 3. Crash activity J by its limit of three weeks because the critical path remains unchanged. The new
expected path times are
A–C–G–J–K: 64 weeks and B–D–H–J–K: 66 weeks
The net savings are 3 ($28,000) - 3($1,000)= $81,000. The total project costs are now $2,624,000 $81,000 = $2,543,000.

STAGE 2
Step 1. The critical path is still B–D–H–J–K.
Step 2. The cheapest activity to crash per week is now D at $2,000.
Step 3. Crash D by two weeks. The first week of reduction in activity D saves $28,000 because it eliminates
a week of penalty costs, as well as indirect costs. Crashing D by a second week saves only $8,000 in
indirect costs because, after week 65, no more penalty costs are incurred. These savings still exceed
the cost of crashing D for a second week. Updated path times are
A–C–G–J–K: 64 weeks and B–D–H–J–K: 64 weeks
The net savings are $28,000 + $8,000 - 21$2,0002 = $32,000. Total project costs are now
$2,543,000 - $32,000 = $2,511,000.
STAGE 3
Step 1. After crashing D, we now have two critical paths. Both critical paths must now be shortened to realize
any savings in indirect project costs. If one is shortened and the other is not, the length of the project
remains unchanged.
Step 2. Our alternatives are to crash one of the following combinations of activities—(A, B); (A, H); (C, B); (C, H);
(G, B); (G, H)—or to crash activity K, which is on both critical paths (J has already been crashed). We
consider only those alternatives for which the cost of crashing is less than the potential savings of
$8,000 per week. The only viable alternatives are (C, B) at a cost of $7,600 per week and K at $4,000
per week. We choose activity K to crash.

Step 3. We crash activity K to the greatest extent possible—a reduction of one week—because it is on both
critical paths. Updated path times are
A–C–G–J–K: 63 weeks and B–D–H–J–K: 63 weeks
The net savings are $8,000 - $4,000 = $4,000. Total project costs are $2,511,000 - $4,000 = $2,507,000.
STAGE 4
Step 1. The critical paths are B–D–H–J–K and A–C–G–J–K.
Step 2. The only viable alternative at this stage is to crash activities B and C simultaneously at a cost of $7,600
per week. This amount is still less than the savings of $8,000 per week.
Step 3. Crash activities B and C by two weeks, the limit for activity B. Updated path times are
A–C–G–J–K: 61 weeks and B–D–H–J–K: 61 weeks
Net savings are 21$8,000) - 21$7,600) = $800. Total project costs are $2,507,000 - $800 = $2,506,200.

DECISION POINT
Because the crash costs exceed weekly indirect costs, any other combination of activities will result in a net increase in total project costs. The minimum-cost schedule is 61 weeks, with a total cost of $2,506,200. To obtain
this schedule, the project team must crash activities B, D, J, and K to their limits and activity C to eight weeks. The
other activities remain at their normal times. This schedule costs $117,800 less than the normal-time schedule.

Assessing Risks
Risk is a measure of the probability and consequence of not reaching a defined project goal. Risk
involves the notion of uncertainty as it relates to project timing and costs. Often, project teams
must deal with uncertainty caused by labor shortages, weather, supply delays, or the outcomes of
critical tests. In this section, we discuss risk management plans and the tools managers can use to
analyze the risks, such as simulation and statistical analysis, which enable managers to estimate
the probability of completing a project on time and the potential for near-critical paths to affect
the project completion time.

Risk-Management Plans
risk-management plan
A plan that identifies the key
risks to a project’s success
and prescribes ways to
circumvent them.

A major responsibility of the project manager at the start of a project is
to develop a risk-management plan, which identifies the key risks to a project’s success and prescribes ways to circumvent them. A good risk-management plan will quantify the risks, predict
their impact on the project, and provide contingency plans. Project risk can be assessed by examining four categories:
 Strategic Fit The project may not be a good strategic fit in that it may not be clearly linked to
the strategic goals of the firm.

MANAGING EFFECTIVE PROJECTS

CHAPTER 2

85

 Service/Product Attributes If the project involves the development of a new service or product, there may be market, technological, or legal risks. There is a chance that competitors may
offer a superior product, or a technological discovery may render the service or product obsolete before it even hits the market. There may also be a legal risk of potential lawsuits or
liability that could force a design change after product development has begun.
 Project Team Capability The project team may not have the capability to complete the project successfully because of the size and complexity of the project or the technology involved.
 Operations There may be an operations risk because of poor information accuracy, lack of
communication, missing precedence relationships, or bad estimates for activity times.
These risks should be identified and the significant ones should have contingency plans in
case something goes wrong. The riskier a project is, the more likely the project will experience difficulties as Managerial Practice 2.1 shows.

Simulation PERT/CPM networks can be used to quantify risks associated with project timing.
Often, the uncertainty associated with an activity can be reflected in the activity’s time duration.
For example, an activity in a new product development project might be developing the enabling

Deadline 2004

When the city of Athens, Greece, was chosen in 1997
as the site for the 2004 Olympic Games, it was a proud moment for the Greek
people. Preparing Athens for the Games would be a huge task that requires a
great deal of planning, manpower, and money. Planners in Athens had a lot of
work to do, starting with the building of 22 facilities. On top of that, more than
10,000 athletes would need a place to stay while competing in the Games. A
total of about 75 miles of new roads, a tram system, a suburban railway, and
a metro system all had to be built to allow the expected spectators, journalists, and athletes to easily move around the congested city. Existing roads and
hotels also needed to be renovated. Another major and costly concern was
security. The Athens Games were taking place in a post-9/11 world, so security was a high priority. The security budget for the 2004 Games was $1.2
billion, four times what it was for the Sydney Olympics just four years earlier.
Officials in Athens saw the awarding of the hosting duties as a sign that
the International Olympic Committee (IOC) had confidence that the city could
stage a successful Olympics. But by early 2000, the IOC was close to taking
the Olympics away from Athens. What went wrong? And could anything have
been done to prevent the delays, skyrocketing costs, and other issues that
plagued the Athens Olympic Games?
One of the biggest problems encountered by the organizers was time.
Construction of the Olympic venues started slowly, which is what led to the
rebuke by the IOC. Once the construction process was finally accelerated,
there was little room in the schedule for further delays. But ancient relics were
found during the construction of the equestrian center, an occurrence that
is common when doing any kind of excavation in history-rich Greece. Construction had to be halted at this venue while archaeologists catalogued and
protected the artifacts. Labor issues and unforeseen terrain problems also
delayed construction. Organizers had expected to be able to perform test runs
in the venues, but many of the facilities weren’t completed until just weeks
before the Games began. The installation of the security system and the construction of the new transportation components also faced delays. Workers
were laboring day and night to complete everything that had to be done. With
no time to spare and many doubts lingering in the air, Athens made itself
ready in time for the opening ceremonies.
The city of Athens did not start planning what to do with the facilities
after the Games were over until after the closing ceremonies. Four years

MANAGERIAL

The Construction of the Olympic Games site In Athens was so far behind
schedule that the International Olympic Committee seriously considered
removing their licence to stage the event. The facilities were completed
just weeks before the start of the games.

after the Games, almost all of the facilities were standing empty and unused,
as the organizers discovered that they had no use for the sports facilities after
the Games were over. Attempts to sell the facilities had been unsuccessful,
and the government was considering tearing down some of them because of
the high costs associated with maintaining the facilities.
Although the 2004 Olympics are an example of meeting major deadlines under pressure, they are also a reminder that good planning and
project management are essential, especially when dealing with a large,
complex project. Although planners and project managers cannot predict
every possible challenge that may arise, they need to build in ways to deal
with these problems so that the project can stay on budget and on time.
Costly missteps in the process almost lost Athens the hosting duties for the
Olympic Games.

technology to manufacture it, an activity that may take from eight months to a year. To incorporate
uncertainty into the network model, probability distributions of activity times can be calculated
using two approaches: (1) computer simulation and (2) statistical analysis. With simulation, the
time for each activity is randomly chosen from its probability distribution (see MyOMLab Supplement E, “Simulation”). The critical path of the network is determined and the completion date of
the project computed. The procedure is repeated many times, which results in a probability distribution for the completion date. We will have more to say about simulation when we discuss near
critical paths later in this chapter.

MyOMLab

Statistical Analysis

The statistical analysis approach requires that activity times be stated in
terms of three reasonable time estimates:
optimistic time (a)

1.

The shortest time in which an
activity can be completed, if all
goes exceptionally well.

The optimistic time (a) is the shortest time in which an activity can be completed, if all goes
exceptionally well.

2.

The most likely time (m) is the probable time required to perform an activity.

3.

The pessimistic time (b) is the longest estimated time required to perform an activity.

most likely time (m)

With three time estimates—the optimistic, the most likely, and the pessimistic—the project
manager has enough information to estimate the probability that an activity will be completed on
schedule. To do so, the project manager must first calculate the mean and variance of a probability distribution for each activity. In PERT/CPM, each activity time is treated as though it were a
random variable derived from a beta probability distribution. This distribution can have various
shapes, allowing the most likely time estimate (m) to fall anywhere between the pessimistic (b) and
optimistic (a) time estimates. The most likely time estimate is the mode of the beta distribution, or
the time with the highest probability of occurrence. This condition is not possible with the normal
distribution, which is symmetrical, because the normal distribution requires the mode to be equidistant from the end points of the distribution. Figure 2.7 shows the difference between the two
distributions.

Analysis
Two key assumptions are required. First, we assume that a, m, and b can be estimated accurately.
The estimates might best be considered values that define a reasonable time range for the activity duration negotiated between the project manager and the team members responsible for the
activities. Second, we assume that the standard deviation, s, of the activity time is one-sixth the
range b - a. Thus, the chance that actual activity times will fall between a and b is high. Why does
this assumption make sense? If the activity time followed the normal distribution, six standard
deviations would span approximately 99.74 percent of the distribution.
Even with these assumptions, derivation of the mean and variance of each activity’s probability distribution is complex. These derivations show that the mean of the beta distribution can be
estimated by using the following weighted average of the three time estimates:
te =

a + 4m + b
6

Note that the most likely time has four times the weight of the pessimistic and optimistic estimates.

MANAGING EFFECTIVE PROJECTS

The variance of the beta distribution for each activity is
s2 = a

b - a 2
b
6

The variance, which is the standard deviation squared, increases as the difference between b and a
increases. This result implies that the less certain a person is in estimating the actual time for an activity, the greater will be the variance.

EXAMPLE 2.4

Calculating Means and Variances

Suppose that the project team has arrived at the following time estimates for activity B (Select site and survey)
of the St. John’s Hospital project:
a = 7 weeks , m = 8 weeks , and b = 15 weeks
a.

Calculate the expected time and variance for activity B.

The expected time for activity B is

Note that the expected time (9 weeks) does not equal the most likely time (8 weeks) for this activity. These
times will be the same only when the most likely time is equidistant from the optimistic and pessimistic times.

DECISION POINT
The project team should notice that the greatest uncertainty lies in the time estimate for activity I, followed by
the estimates for activities E and G. These activities should be analyzed for the source of the uncertainties and
actions should be taken to reduce the variance in the time estimates.

CHAPTER 2

PART 1

COMPETING WITH OPERATIONS

Analyzing Probabilities

Because time estimates for activities involve uncertainty, project
managers are interested in determining the probability of meeting project completion deadlines. To develop the probability distribution for project completion time, we assume that the
duration time of one activity does not depend on that of any other activity. This assumption enables us to estimate the mean and variance of the probability distribution of the time duration
of the entire project by summing the duration times and variances of the activities along the
critical path. However, if one work crew is assigned two activities that can be done at the same
time, the activity times will be interdependent and the assumption is not valid. In addition, if
other paths in the network have small amounts of slack, one of them might become the critical
path before the project is completed; we should calculate a probability distribution for those
paths as well.
Because of the assumption that the activity duration times are independent random variables,
we can make use of the central limit theorem, which states that the sum of a group of independent, identically distributed random variables approaches a normal distribution as the number
of random variables increases. The mean of the normal distribution is the sum of the expected
activity times on the path. In the case of the critical path, it is the earliest expected finish time for
the project:
TE = g 1Expected activity times on the critical path 2 = Mean of normal distribution

Similarly, because of the assumption of activity time independence, we use the sum of the variances of the activities along the path as the variance of the time distribution for that path. That is, for
the critical path,
s2P = g 1Variances of activities on the critical path 2
To analyze probabilities of completing a project by a certain date using the normal distribution, we focus on the critical path and use the z-transformation formula:
z =

T - TE
sP

where
T = due date for the project
Given the value of z, we use the Normal Distribution appendix to find the probability that the
project will be completed by time T, or sooner. An implicit assumption in this approach is that no
other path will become critical during the time span of the project. Example 2.5, part (a), demonstrates this calculation for the St. John’s Hospital project.
The procedure for assessing the probability of completing any activity in a project by a specific date is similar to the one just discussed. However, instead of the critical path, we would use
the longest time path of activities from the start node to the activity node in question.

Near-Critical Paths A project’s duration is a function of its critical path. However, paths that are
close to the same duration as the critical path may ultimately become the critical path over the life
of the project. In practice, at the start of the project, managers typically do not know the activity
times with certainty and may never know which path was the critical path until the actual activity times are known at the end of the project. Nonetheless, this uncertainty does not reduce the
usefulness of identifying the probability of one path or another causing a project to exceed its
target completion time; it helps to identify the activities that need close management attention.
To assess the chances of near-critical paths delaying the project completion, we can focus on the
longest paths in the project network keeping in mind that both duration and variance along the
path must be considered. Shorter paths with high variances could have just as much a chance to
delay the project as longer paths with smaller variances. We can then estimate the probability that
a given path will exceed the project target completion time. We demonstrate that approach using
statistical analysis in Example 2.5, part (b).
Alternatively, simulation can be used to estimate the probabilities. The advantage of simulation is that you are not restricted to the use of the beta distribution for activity times. Also, activity
or path dependencies, such as decision points that could involve different groups of activities to
be undertaken, can be incorporated in a simulation model much more easily than with the statistical analysis approach. Fortunately, regardless of the approach used, it is rarely necessary to
evaluate every path in the network. In large networks, many paths will have both short durations
and low variances, making them unlikely to affect the project duration.

MANAGING EFFECTIVE PROJECTS

Calculate the probability that St. John’s Hospital will become operational in 72 weeks, using (a) the critical path
and (b) near-critical path A–C–G–J–K.
SOLUTION
The critical path B–D–H–J–K has a length of 69 weeks. From the table in Example 2.4, we obtain the
variance of path B–D–H–J–K: s2P = 1.78 + 1.78 + 2.78 + 5.44 + 0.11 = 11.89. Next, we calculate
the z-value:

Using the Normal Distribution appendix, we go down the left-hand column until we arrive at
the value 0.8, and then across until we arrive at the 0.07 column, which shows a tabular value
of 0.8078. Consequently, we find that the probability is about 0.81 that the length of path
B–D–H–J–K will be no greater than 72 weeks. Because this path is the critical path, there is a
19 percent probability that the project will take longer than 72 weeks. This probability is shown
graphically in Figure 2.8.

The probability is about 0.90 that the length of path A–C–G–J–K will be no greater than 72 weeks.
DECISION POINT
The project team should be aware of the 10 percent chance that path A–C–G–J–K will exceed the target
completion date of week 72. Although the probability is not high for that path, activities A, C, and G bear
watching during the first 57 weeks of the project to make sure no more than 2 weeks of slippage occurs in
their schedules. This attention is especially important for activity G, which has a high time variance.

Monitoring and Controlling Projects
Once project planning is over, the challenge becomes keeping the project on schedule
within the budget of allocated resources. In this section, we discuss how to monitor
project status and resource usage. In addition, we identify the features of project management software useful for monitoring and controlling projects.

Monitoring Project Status
A good tracking system will help the project team accomplish its project goals. Effective tracking systems collect information on three topics: (1) open issues, (2) risks, and
(3) schedule status.

Schedule Status

Even the best laid project plans can go awry. A tracking system that
provides periodic monitoring of slack time in the project schedule can help the project
manager control activities along the critical path. Periodic updating of the status of ongoing activities in the project allows the tracking system to recalculate activity slacks

Visual & Written/SuperStock

Open Issues and Risks One of the duties of the project manager is to make sure that
issues that have been raised during the project actually get resolved in a timely fashion. The tracking system should remind the project manager of due dates for open
issues and who was responsible for seeing that they are resolved. Likewise, it should
provide the status of each risk to project delays specified in the risk management plan
so that the team can review them at each meeting. To be effective, the tracking system
requires team members to update information periodically regarding their respective
responsibilities.
Monitoring and controlling shipbuilding projects is critical to keeping these complex projects on schedule. Here a propeller is attached

and indicate those activities that are behind schedule or are in danger of using up all of their slack.
Management can then focus on those activities and reallocate resources as needed.

Monitoring Project Resources

Resource Requirements

Definition
and
organization

Experience has shown that the resources allocated to a project are consumed at an uneven rate
that is a function of the timing of the schedules for the project’s activities. Projects have a life
cycle that consists of four major phases: (1) definition and organization, (2) planning, (3) execution, and (4) close out. Figure 2.9 shows that each of the four phases requires different resource
commitments.
We have already discussed the activities associated with the project definition and organization and
Planning
Execution
Close out
project planning phases. The phase that takes the
most resources is the execution phase, during which
managers focus on activities pertaining to deliverables. The project schedule becomes very important
because it shows when each resource devoted to a
given activity will be required. Monitoring the progress of activities throughout the project is important
to avoid potential overloading of resources. Problems
arise when a specific resource, such as a construction
crew or staff specialist, is required on several activities
with overlapping schedules. Project managers have
several options to alleviate resource problems, including the following:

Start

Finish
Time

 FIGURE 2.9
Project Life Cycle

  Resource Leveling. The attempt to reduce the
peaks and valleys in resource needs by shifting the
schedules of conflicting activities within their earliest and latest start dates. Software packages such
as MS Project have algorithms that move activities
to avoid violating resource constraints.

 Resource Allocation. The assignment of resources to the most important activities. Most
popular project management software packages have a few priority rules that can be
used to decide which activity a critical resource should be scheduled to perform when
conflicts arise. For example, for all the activities requiring a given resource, assign the
resource to the one with the earliest start time. An activity slack report identifies potential candidates for resource shifting—shift resources from high slack activities to those
behind schedule.
 Resource Acquisition. The addition of more of an overloaded resource to maintain the schedule of an activity. Obviously, this tactic is constrained by the project budget.

Controlling Projects

close out
An activity that includes writing
final reports, completing remaining deliverables, and compiling
the team’s recommendations for
improving the project process.

Project managers have the responsibilities of accounting for the effective use of the firm’s resources as well as managing the activities to achieve the time and quality goals of the project. The
firm’s assets include the physical assets, human resources, and financial resources. Physical assets
are controlled by the timely maintenance of machines and equipment so that their failure does
not delay the project. Inventories must be received, stored for future use, and replenished. Project
managers are also responsible for human resource development. Projects provide a rich environment to develop future leaders; project managers can take advantage of the situation by assigning
team members important activities to aid in their managerial development. Last, but not least,
project managers must control the expenditures of the firm’s financial resources. Most project
management software packages contain accounting reports, budget reports, capital investment
controls, and cash flow reports. Deviations from the project plan, often referred to as variances,
must be periodically reported and analyzed for their causes.
Monitoring and controlling projects are ongoing activities throughout the execution phase
of the project life cycle. The project close out, however, is an activity that many project managers
forget to include in their consideration of resource usage. The purpose of this final phase in the
project life cycle is to write final reports and complete remaining deliverables. An important aspect of this phase, however, is compiling the team’s recommendations for improving the project
process of which they were a part. Many team members will be assigned to other projects where
they can apply what they learned.

 Define the major activities associated with defining, organizing,

planning, monitoring, and controlling projects. The entire outline
of Chapter 2 revolves around these five very important activities.
Nonetheless, be sure to read the opener to the chapter, which
shows the four major phases of the project to introduce the new
XBOX 360 product, the introduction to the chapter, and the section “Defining and Organizing Projects,” pp. 71–72.

 Explain how to determine a minimum-cost project schedule.

The section “Analyzing Cost-Time Tradeoffs,” pp. 80–84, and
Example 2.3 demonstrate how the relevant costs must be considered to minimize costs. Figure 2.6 explains a key assumption
in the analysis. Solved Problem 2 contains a detailed solution.

 Describe the considerations managers make in assessing the

risks in a project and calculate the probability of completing a
project on time. See the section “Assessing Risks,” pp. 84–86,
which explains the risks faced by project managers. The section
“Analysis,” pp. 86–89, shows how to compute probabilities. Be
sure to understand Examples 2.4 and 2.5 and Solved Problem 1.

 Diagram the network of interrelated activities in a project.

See “Defining the Work Breakdown Structure,” pp. 73–74, and
“Diagramming the Network,” pp. 74–76. Figure 2.2 and Example 2.1
are important for achieving this learning goal.

 Identify the sequence of critical activities that determines the

duration of a project. Study the section “Developing the Schedule,”
pp. 77–80, and Example 2.2 for an understanding of the critical path.

 Define the options available to alleviate resource problems. See
the section “Monitoring and Controlling Projects,” pp. 89–90.

MyOMLab helps you develop analytical skills and assesses your progress with
multiple problems on identifying the critical path, calculating an activity’s slack, expected

With these activity durations, the project will be completed in 19 days and incur a $700 penalty. Determining a good completion date requires the use of the minimum-cost schedule
procedure. Using the data provided in Table 2.2, you can determine the maximum crashtime reduction and crash cost per day for each activity. For example, for activity A
Maximum crash time = Normal time - Crash time =
4 days - 3 days = 1 day
Crash cost per day =

Crash cost - Normal cost
CC - NC

Normal time - Crash time

Table 2.3 summarizes the analysis and the resultant project duration and total cost. The
critical path is C–F–H at 19 days, which is the longest path in the network. The cheapest of
these acvtivities to crash is H, which costs only an extra $100 per day to crash. Doing so saves
$200 + $100 = $300 per day in indirect and penalty costs. If you crash this activity for two days
(the maximum), the lengths of the paths are now
A–D–G–H: 15 days, B–E–G–H: 15 days, and C–F–H: 17 days
The critical path is still C–F–H. The next cheapest critical activity to crash is F at $250 per day.
You can crash F only two days because at that point you will have three critical paths. Further
reductions in project duration will require simultaneous crashing of more than one activity (D,
E, and F). The cost to do so, $650, exceeds the savings, $300. Consequently, you should stop. Note
that every activity is critical. The project costs are minimized when the completion date is day 15.
However, some goodwill costs may be associated with disappointing a customer who wants delivery in 12 days.

Discussion Questions
1.

Define risk as it applies to projects.What are the major
sources of risk in a project?

2.

One of your colleagues comments that software is the
ultimate key to project management success. How would
you respond?

3.

Explain how to determine the slack for each activity in a
project. Why is it important for managers to know where
the slack is in their projects?

Problems
The OM Explorer and POM for Windows software is available
to all students using the 10th edition of this textbook. Go to
www.pearsonglobaleditions.com/krajewski to download
these computer packages. If you purchased MyOMLab, you
also have access to Active Models software and significant help
in doing the following problems. Check with your instructor
on how best to use these resources. In many cases, the instructor wants you to understand how to do the calculations by
hand. At the least, the software provides a check on your calculations. When calculations are particularly complex and the
goal is interpreting the results in making decisions, the software replaces entirely the manual calculations.

VIDEO CASE

Project Management at the Phoenician

The Phoenician in Phoenix, Arizona, is part of Starwood’s Luxury Collection and its only AAA Five Diamond Award resort in the southwestern United
States. Sophistication, elegance, and excellence only begin to describe the
guest experience at the hotel. Guests can dine in one of nine restaurants,
relax poolside, play tennis, take in 27 holes of golf on three 9-hole courses,
or relax with a variety of soothing spa treatments at the 22,000-square-foot
Centre for Well-Being.
The Phoenician recently embarked on an ambitious $38 million spa
and golf renovation program. The resort’s golf and spa programs historically
earned high marks from surveys in their industries over the years, but the environment was changing. Evidence of this change was seen in the explosive
growth of new golf courses and spas in the Southwest region. Phoenix alone
has over 275 golf courses, and the Southwest boasts the largest concentration of new luxury spas anywhere. The Phoenician’s facilities, while worldclass and highly rated, were more than 15 years old. The hotel’s recently
awarded Five Diamond status renewed emphasis on bringing every process
and service at the property up to Five Diamond level.
The decision to renovate the golf course and existing spa became not
a question of whether to undertake the projects, but to what degree they
needed to be pursued. Key considerations centered on (1) whether to build
basic facilities or commit to the grandiose luxury level, (2) having a domestic versus international reputation, and (3) developing creative packaging of
the new facilities to attract loyal guests, such as a spa and golf “country
club-like” membership program. Such a program would be limited to about
600 spa/golf memberships, with a one-time fee of $65,000 each.

Work Breakdown Structure

The company’s senior management considered three options for the
Centre for Well-Being spa. First, the existing space in the heart of the resort
could be renovated. This option would require relocating the spa to another
part of the resort and offering limited treatments during this time, thereby
reducing spa revenues significantly. With option 2, hilly terrain directly behind the resort could be carved out to create a new mountainside facility with
sweeping vistas. This option meant the closure of one of the hotel’s buildings
housing 60 guest rooms and suites during the construction period. The existing spa could remain open, however. Under option 3, a parking structure on
existing hotel property could be used, having the least impact on revenues.
The first option was seen as a short-term fix, while the remaining two were
viewed as having longer-term potential.
Additional discussion centered on the type of spa to be built. Recent
acquisition of the Bliss spa brand for Starwood’s W Hotels was an option,
offering day spa amenities and an indulgence atmosphere. The second option
was to remain a holistic resort spa with an emphasis on health and restoration. The third option was to become a destination spa with dedicated guest
stays and week-long programs. Day spas are the fastest-growing category,
with few destination spas.
The Phoenician management team, with assistance from Starwood
Field Operations and Corporate offices, prepared an extensive analysis of
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to better understand
the environment. The result of this analysis was used by the team to identify the set of activities necessary for each option. The Corporate Design
and Construction group developed architectural and engineering plans, as

QUESTIONS

When the Phoenician, a luxury hotel in Phoenix, Arizona, sought to redesign its Center for Well-Being, its management team created a work
breakdown structure in order to compare different project options and
choose the best one.

The Pert Mustang

Roberts Auto Sales and Service (RASAS) consists of three car dealerships that
sell and service several makes of American and Japanese cars, two auto parts
stores, a large body shop and car painting business, and an auto salvage yard.
Vicky Roberts, owner of RASAS, went into the car business when she inherited
a Ford dealership from her father. She was able to capitalize on her knowledge
and experience to build her business into the diversified and successful miniempire it is today. Her motto, “Sell ‘em today, repair ‘em tomorrow!” reflects a
strategy that she refers to in private as “Get ‘em coming and going.”
Roberts has always retained a soft spot in her heart for high-performance
Mustangs and just acquired a 1965 Shelby Mustang GT 350 that needs a lot
of restoration. She also notes the public’s growing interest in the restoration of
vintage automobiles. Roberts is thinking of expanding into the vintage car restoration business and needs help in assessing the feasibility of such a move.
She wants to restore her 1965 Shelby Mustang to mint condition, or as close
to mint condition as possible. If she decides to go into the car restoring business, she can use the Mustang as an exhibit in sales and advertising and take
it to auto shows to attract business for the new shop.
Roberts believes that many people want the thrill of restoring an old
car themselves, but they do not have the time to run down all the old parts.
Still, others just want to own a vintage auto because it is different and many
of them have plenty of money to pay someone to restore an auto for them.
Roberts wants the new business to appeal to both types of people.
For the first group, she envisions serving as a parts broker for NOS (“new
old stock”), new parts that were manufactured many years ago and are still
packaged in their original cartons. It can be a time-consuming process to find
the right part. RASAS could also machine new parts to replicate those that
are hard to find or that no longer exist.
In addition, RASAS could assemble a library of parts and body manuals
for old cars to serve as an information resource for do-it-yourself restorers.
The do-it-yourselfers could come to RASAS for help in compiling parts lists,
and RASAS could acquire the parts for them. For others, RASAS would take
charge of the entire restoration.
Roberts asked the director of service operations to take a good look at
her Mustang and determine what needs to be done to restore it to the condition it was in when it came from the factory more than 40 years ago. She

wants to restore this car in time to exhibit it at the Detroit Auto Show. If the
car gets a lot of press, it will be a real public relations coup for RASAS—
especially if Roberts decides to enter this new venture. Even if she does not,
the car will be a showpiece for the rest of the business.
Roberts asked the director of service operations to prepare a report
about what is involved in restoring the car and whether it can be done in
time for the Detroit show in 45 working days using PERT/CPM. The parts
manager, the body shop manager, and the chief mechanic have provided the
following estimates of times and activities that need to be done, as well as
cost estimates:
a. Order all needed material and parts (upholstery, windshield, carburetor,
and oil pump). Time: 2 days. Cost (telephone calls and labor): $100.
b. Receive upholstery material for seat covers. Cannot be done until order
is placed. Time: 30 days. Cost: $2,100.
c. Receive windshield. Cannot be done until order is placed. Time:
10 days. Cost: $800.
d. Receive carburetor and oil pump. Cannot be done until order is placed.
Time: 7 days. Cost: $1,750.
e. Remove chrome from body. Can be done immediately. Time: 1 day.
Cost: $200.
f. Remove body (doors, hood, trunk, and fenders) from frame. Cannot be
done until chrome is removed. Time: 1 day. Cost: $300.
g. Have fenders repaired by body shop. Cannot be done until body is
removed from frame. Time: 4 days. Cost: $1,000.
h. Repair doors, trunk, and hood. Cannot be done until body is removed
from frame. Time: 6 days. Cost: $1,500.
i. Pull engine from chassis. Do after body is removed from frame. Time:
1 day. Cost: $200.
j. Remove rust from frame. Do after the engine has been pulled from the
chassis. Time: 3 days. Cost $900.
k. Regrind engine valves. Do after the engine has been pulled from the
chassis. Time: 5 days. Cost: $1,000.

Roberts wants to limit expenditures on this project to what could be
recovered by selling the restored car. She has already spent $50,000 to acquire the car. In addition, she wants a brief report on some of the aspects of
the proposed business, such as how it fits in with RASAS’s other businesses
and what RASAS’s operations task should be with regard to cost, quality,
customer service, and flexibility.

In the restoration business there are various categories of restoration.
A basic restoration gets the car looking great and running, but a mint condition
restoration puts the car back in original condition—as it was “when it rolled
off the line.” When restored cars are resold, a car in mint condition commands
a much higher price than one that is just a basic restoration. As cars are restored, they can also be customized. That is, something is put on the car that
could not have been on the original. Roberts wants a mint condition restoration
for her Mustang, without customization. (The proposed new business would
accept any kind of restoration a customer wanted.)
The total budget cannot exceed $70,000 including the $50,000 Roberts
has already spent. In addition, Roberts cannot spend more than $3,600 in
any week given her present financial position. Even though much of the work
will be done by Roberts’s own employees, labor and materials costs must be
considered. All relevant costs have been included in the cost estimates.

QUESTIONS
1.

Using the information provided, prepare the report that Vicky Roberts
requested, assuming that the project will begin immediately. Assume
45 working days are available to complete the project, including transporting the car to Detroit before the auto show begins. Your report
should briefly discuss the aspects of the proposed new business, such
as the competitive priorities that Roberts asked about.
2. Construct a table containing the project activities using the letter assigned to each activity, the time estimates, and the precedence relationships from which you will assemble the network diagram.
3. Draw a network diagram of the project similar to Figure 2.4. Determine
the activities on the critical path and the estimated slack for each activity.
4. Prepare a project budget showing the cost of each activity and the total
for the project. Can the project be completed within the budget? Will the
project require more than $3,600 in any week? To answer this question, assume that activities B, C, and D must be paid for when the item
is received (the earliest finish time for the activity). Assume that the
costs of all other activities that span more than one week can be prorated. Each week contains five work days. If problems exist, how might
Roberts overcome them?
